My Record Cataloging App
------------------------

This is an application that will help me catalog my vinyl record collection. I will probably add all of my music at some point as well.

This stack includes Node, Express 4, MongoDB, Backbone. I used the Yeoman generator (Stacked), which uses Bower to create the boilerplate. Mocha is included for testing too. I may or may not use TDD for this application.
